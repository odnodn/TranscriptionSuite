## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Features

- **100% Local**: *Everything* runs on your own computer, the app doesn't need internet beyond the initial setup*
- **Multiple Models available**: On **Docker/Linux/Windows**: *WhisperX* ([`faster-whisper`](https://huggingface.co/Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3) models), NVIDIA NeMo [*Parakeet v3*](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3)/[*Canary v2*](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/canary-1b-v2), [*VibeVoice-ASR*](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR), and [*whisper.cpp*](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) (GGML models for AMD/Intel GPU via Vulkan — Linux via Docker sidecar; Windows via native `whisper-server.exe` auto-downloaded by the app, see §2.5). On **Apple Silicon (Metal)**: [*MLX Whisper*](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo-asr-fp16) (tiny → large-v3-turbo), [*MLX Parakeet v3*](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3), [*MLX Canary v2*](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/canary-1b-v2), and [*MLX VibeVoice-ASR*](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/VibeVoice-ASR-bf16) - all running natively without Docker
- **Speaker Diarization**: Speaker identification & diarization (subtitling) for Whisper, NeMo, and VibeVoice models; Whisper and NeMo use PyAnnote for diarization while VibeVoice does it by itself (not available for whisper.cpp models). On Apple Silicon, [*Sortformer*](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/diar_sortformer_4spk-v1-fp32) provides Metal-native diarization for up to 4 speakers - no HuggingFace token required
- **Parallel Processing**: If your VRAM budget allows it, transcribe & diarize a recording at the same time - speeding up processing time significantly
- **Truly Multilingual**: Whisper supports [90+ languages](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py); NeMo Parakeet/Canary support [25 European languages](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3); VibeVoice supports [51 languages](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR)
- **Longform Transcription**: Record as long as you want and have it transcribed in seconds; either using your mic or the system audio
- **Session File Import**: Import existing audio files from the Session tab; transcription results are saved directly as `.txt` or `.srt` to a folder of your choice - no Notebook entry created
- **Live Mode**: Real-time sentence-by-sentence transcription for continuous dictation workflows (available for Whisper and whisper.cpp/GGML models; not available for NeMo or VibeVoice models)
- **Global Keyboard Shortcuts**: System-wide shortcuts & paste-at-cursor functionality
- **Remote Access**: Securely access your desktop at home running the model from anywhere (utilizing Tailscale) or share it on your local network via LAN
- **Audio Notebook**: An Audio Notebook mode, with a calendar-based view, full-text search, and AI assistant (chat with any OpenAI-compatible provider about your notes - LM Studio, Ollama, OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, and others)


📌*Half an hour of audio transcribed in under a minute with Whisper (RTX 3060)!*

**All transcription processing runs entirely on your own computer - your audio never leaves your machine. Internet is only needed to download model weights on first use (STT models, PyAnnote diarization, and wav2vec2 alignment models); all weights are cached locally in a Docker volume and no further internet access is required after that.*

## 2. Installation

To begin with, let me explain simply how this setup works. The app is comprised of **two** parts - a lightweight frontend (**Dashboard**) plus the server backend (**Docker image**). Both are obviously required *(with some exceptions)*. The [*Releases*](https://github.com/homelab-00/TranscriptionSuite/releases) page contains the Dashboard only; the server can be downloaded from inside the Dashboard app.

Pick the section for your platform:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| **Apple Silicon Mac (M1+)** | → [§ 2.1](#21-macos-apple-silicon-or-intel) |
| **Intel Mac (pre-M1)** | → [§ 2.1](#21-macos-apple-silicon-or-intel) |
| **Linux / Windows** | → [§§ 2.2–2.5](#22-linux-and-windows) - Docker/Podman-based |

---

### 2.1 macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)

#### What hardware acceleration you get

- **Apple Silicon Macs (M1 and later):** full GPU acceleration via Apple's **Metal + MLX** stack. Metal is Apple's GPU API; MLX is Apple's machine-learning framework that runs on top of Metal and is specifically built for Apple Silicon's unified-memory architecture. This is what the app calls the "Metal server" — it's really MLX running on Metal.
- **Intel Macs (pre-M1):** **CPU only**. MLX does not exist on Intel Macs — it's Apple-Silicon-only. Metal the GPU API does exist on Intel Macs, but this project does not use it outside of MLX. Intel Macs run the transcription backend in a Docker container, on CPU. It works, but it's slow.

> *Naming note: anywhere in the app's UI you see "Metal server", "Start Metal Server", or "Metal runtime", what's actually running is **MLX** — Apple's machine-learning framework, which uses Metal as its GPU API. The two terms are used loosely as synonyms in the UI, but only MLX is Apple-Silicon-only; plain Metal works on many Intel Macs too. If you have an Intel Mac with a Metal-capable GPU, the "Metal" label still does not apply to you — this project's Metal path requires MLX, which requires Apple Silicon.*

#### The two macOS install artifacts

Every release ships two DMGs on the [Releases](https://github.com/homelab-00/TranscriptionSuite/releases) page. Pick the one that matches your plan:

| Artifact | For | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TranscriptionSuite-<ver>-arm64-mac-metal.dmg` | **Bundled MLX/Metal server on this Mac** (Apple Silicon only) | ~3-5 GB | Dashboard + Python 3.13 + MLX backend pre-installed inside the `.app`. No Docker, no Python setup. Launch the app, click **Start Metal Server**. |
| `TranscriptionSuite-<ver>-arm64-mac.dmg` or `TranscriptionSuite-<ver>-x64-mac.dmg` | **Thin client** — dashboard only, you bring the server | ~200 MB | The dashboard UI by itself. Use this when the transcription work will happen **somewhere else**: either a remote server (Linux/Windows box with a GPU over Tailscale/LAN) or a Docker/Podman container running locally on this Mac. Pick `arm64` for Apple Silicon, `x64` for Intel. |

Three use cases, mapped to artifacts:

| Your use case | DMG to download |
|---|---|
| Apple Silicon Mac, run server locally on Metal/MLX | `arm64-mac-metal.dmg` (bundled) |
| Apple Silicon Mac, connect to a remote server | `arm64-mac.dmg` (thin) |
| Apple Silicon Mac, run server locally in Docker/Podman | `arm64-mac.dmg` (thin) |
| Intel Mac, connect to a remote server | `x64-mac.dmg` (thin) |
| Intel Mac, run server locally in Docker/Podman (CPU only) | `x64-mac.dmg` (thin) |

> Apple Silicon users running a local Metal server can ignore the thin DMG entirely — the bundled DMG covers everything. Intel Macs never get the bundled DMG (no MLX).

#### Install steps

1. Download the DMG for your case from the Releases page.
2. Open it and drag `TranscriptionSuite.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Open Terminal and run this once to clear the macOS Gatekeeper quarantine on the
   ad-hoc-signed bundle (see `Installation Instructions.txt` on the DMG for details):

   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/TranscriptionSuite.app
   ```

4. Launch the app, then:
   - **Bundled DMG (Apple Silicon, local Metal):** open **Settings → Runtime Profile**, choose **Metal (Apple Silicon)**, click **Start Metal Server**. You're done.
   - **Thin DMG, connecting to a remote server:** skip Docker setup. Follow the remote-server configuration in [§ 2.5](#25-remote-access).
   - **Thin DMG, running the server locally in Docker/Podman:** install Docker or Podman per §§ 2.2–2.4 first (Intel Macs and Apple Silicon users follow the same Docker install steps), then continue with [§ 2.3](#23-download-the-dashboard-app).

---

### 2.2 Linux and Windows

Install Docker (or Podman) before proceeding with §§ 2.3–2.5.

> *Both are supported; the dashboard and shell scripts auto-detect which runtime is available (Docker is checked first, then Podman).*

**Linux (Docker):**

1. Install Docker Engine
    * For Arch run `sudo pacman -S --needed docker`
    * For other distros refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Add your user to the `docker` group so the app can talk to Docker without `sudo`:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
    Then **log out and back in** (or reboot) for the change to take effect.
3. Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for GPU mode)
    * Refer to the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
    * Not required if using CPU mode

**Linux (Podman):**

1. Install Podman (4.7+ required for `podman compose` support)
    * For Arch run `sudo pacman -S --needed podman`
    * For Fedora/RHEL: Podman is pre-installed
    * For other distros refer to the [Podman documentation](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
2. Enable the Podman API socket (required for compose operations):
    ```bash
    systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
    ```
    * `podman compose` delegates to an external compose provider (e.g. `docker-compose`) that connects via this socket. Without it, compose commands will fail with "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon" even though `podman` itself works.
3. For GPU mode, configure CDI (Container Device Interface):
    ```bash
    sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml
    ```
    * Requires nvidia-container-toolkit 1.14+
    * Not required if using CPU mode

**Windows:**
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with WSL2 backend (during installation, if presented with the option, make sure the *'Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V'* checkbox is enabled).
After installation to make sure it's enabled, run `wsl --list --verbose` - if the number is 2, Docker is using the WSL 2 backend.
2. Install NVIDIA GPU driver with WSL support (standard NVIDIA gaming drivers work fine)
    * Not required if using CPU mode

**macOS (running the server locally in Docker/Podman):** Install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
or [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/). This path applies to both Intel Macs (which have no other option for a local server — MLX is Apple-Silicon-only) and Apple Silicon users who prefer Docker over the bundled Metal DMG. GPU acceleration is not available through Docker on macOS; the server runs in CPU mode.

### 2.3 Download the Dashboard app

Before doing anything else, you need to download **and install** the Dashboard app for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/homelab-00/TranscriptionSuite/releases) page.
This is just the frontend - no models or packages are downloaded yet, but it must be installed before setting up the server in the next step.

>* *Linux and Windows builds are x64; macOS ships both arm64 and x64 DMGs — see [§ 2.1](#21-macos-apple-silicon-or-intel) for which to pick*
>* *Each release artifact includes an gpg signature by my key (`.asc`)*

##### 2.3.1 Linux AppImage Prerequisites

AppImages require **FUSE 2** (`libfuse.so.2`), which is not installed by default on distros that ship with GNOME (both Fedora & Arch KDE worked fine out of the box). If you see `dlopen(): error loading libfuse.so.2`, install the appropriate package:

| Distribution | Package | Install Command |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian | `libfuse2` | `sudo apt install libfuse2` |
| Ubuntu 24.04+ | `libfuse2t64` | `sudo apt install libfuse2t64` |
| Fedora | `fuse-libs` | `sudo dnf install fuse-libs` |
| Arch Linux | `fuse2` | `sudo pacman -S fuse2` |

> **Sandbox note:** The AppImage automatically disables Chromium's SUID sandbox
> (`--no-sandbox`) since the AppImage squashfs mount cannot satisfy its permission
> requirements. This is the standard approach for Electron-based AppImages and does
> not affect application security.

##### 2.3.2 Verify Download with Kleopatra (optional)

1. Download both files from the same release:
   - installer/app (`.AppImage`, `.exe` or `.dmg`)
   - matching signature file (`.asc`)
2. Install Kleopatra: https://apps.kde.org/kleopatra/
3. Import the public key in Kleopatra from this repository:
   - [`docs/assets/homelab-00_0xBFE4CC5D72020691_public.asc`](assets/homelab-00_0xBFE4CC5D72020691_public.asc)
4. In Kleopatra, use `File` -> `Decrypt/Verify Files...` and select the downloaded `.asc` signature.
5. If prompted, select the corresponding downloaded app file. Verification should report a valid signature.

### 2.4 Setting Up the Server

We're now ready to start the server. This process includes two parts: downloading the Docker image and starting a Docker container based off of that image.

> **Windows:** Make sure Docker Desktop is already running before proceeding. The server setup will fail if Docker Desktop is not started first.

1. *Download the image*: Using the Sidebar on the left, head over to the Server tab and click the button 'Fetch Fresh Image'
2. *Starting the container*: Scroll down a bit and click the 'Start Local' button in the #2 box
3. *Initial setup - models, diarization*: A series of prompts will ask you for which models you want to download to begin with, and if you want to enable diarization. Specifically for diarization, you need to enter your HuggingFace token and accept the [terms of the model](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1). To create a token, go to your [HuggingFace token settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), click *Create new token*, and select **Read** as the access type (Write or Fine-grained are not needed).
4. **Wait** - Initial startup can take a long time, even on newer hardware and fast internet speeds; we're talking 10-20 minutes with reasonable specs though, not hours; you'll know it's done when the server status light turns green
5. **Start the client**: Head to the Session tab and click on the 'Start Local' button inside the Client Link box - if it turns green you're ready to roll!

<br>

Notes:
* *Settings are saved to:*
  * *- Linux: `~/.config/TranscriptionSuite/`*
  * *- Windows: `%APPDATA%\TranscriptionSuite\`*
  * *- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/`*

* *GNOME note: The [AppIndicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) extension is required for system tray support.*

* *Docker vs Podman:*
*TranscriptionSuite supports both Docker and Podman. The dashboard and CLI scripts auto-detect which runtime is available. For GPU mode with Podman, ensure CDI is configured (`sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml`).*
*Podman 4.7+ is required for `podman compose` support.*

* *Older NVIDIA GPUs (GTX 1000-series and earlier — Pascal / Maxwell):*
  *The default Docker image ships PyTorch built for Volta and newer GPUs (RTX 20-series and up). If your card is Pascal- or Maxwell-generation it will be rejected by PyTorch and the container will crash-loop with an error like "NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 with CUDA capability sm_61 is not compatible with the current PyTorch installation". Affected cards include:*
  * *GeForce GTX 10-series — 1050 / 1060 / 1070 / 1080 (and Ti variants)*
  * *GeForce GTX 900-series and GTX 750 / 750 Ti*
  * *Tesla P4 / P40 / P100 / M40*
  * *Quadro P-series and M-series*

  *Fix: switch to the **legacy-GPU image** — a separate image we build from the same Dockerfile but pinned to the cu126 PyTorch wheels (which still cover sm_50..sm_90). Steps:*
  1. *In the Server tab, set the runtime to **GPU (CUDA)** (the legacy-GPU toggle only appears under this runtime).*
  2. *If the container already exists, stop the server and remove it via the cleanup controls.*
  3. *Flip the **Use legacy-GPU image (GTX 10-series / 900-series and older)** toggle. Confirm the dialog and leave "Wipe runtime volume now (recommended)" checked so the next bootstrap re-syncs the cu126 wheels cleanly.*
  4. *Click **Fetch Fresh Image** to pull the legacy image, then **Start Local**. The first start re-downloads PyTorch and dependencies (10-20 minutes on reasonable hardware); subsequent starts are normal speed.*

  *Once running, the legacy image behaves identically to the default. If you later move to a Volta-or-newer card, flip the toggle back off — leaving it on a modern GPU just gives you older PyTorch wheels for no benefit.*

### 2.5 AMD / Intel GPU Support (Vulkan)

If you have an **AMD or Intel GPU** instead of NVIDIA, you can get GPU-accelerated transcription using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) with Vulkan. Two paths are available: a **Linux** path (Docker sidecar) and a **Windows** path (native `whisper-server.exe` managed by the app).

On Linux, this works by running a second helper container (called whisper-server) alongside the main TranscriptionSuite container. On Windows, the app instead launches `whisper-server.exe` natively on your host and the Docker backend reaches it via `host.docker.internal:8080`.

#### 2.5.1 Linux (stable)

**What you need:**

- An AMD GPU with Vulkan support (RDNA1 or newer, e.g. RX 5500 XT, RX 6600, RX 7800 XT)
- Or an Intel GPU with Vulkan support (Arc A-series or integrated Xe graphics)
- Docker installed (Podman is not yet supported for Vulkan mode)
- A Linux host with `/dev/dri/renderD128` (a real DRI render node from the AMD/Intel kernel driver)

#### 2.5.2 Windows (GPU Vulkan Windows)

**What you need:**

- An AMD or Intel GPU with current Windows drivers
- Docker Desktop on Windows with the **WSL2 backend enabled** (Settings → General → "Use the WSL 2 based engine")

**How it works:**

The Windows path runs a native `whisper-server.exe` directly on your Windows host — not inside Docker. The app downloads it automatically on first use and manages its full lifecycle (start, stop, crash recovery). The Docker backend reaches it via `http://host.docker.internal:8080`. This avoids the AVX2 requirement that containerised Vulkan builds impose, meaning it works on a wider range of CPUs.

**How to set it up:**

1. In the **Server tab**, open **Instance Settings** and select **GPU (Vulkan Windows)** as the runtime profile.
2. In the Server tab image selector, choose the latest image tag (e.g. `v1.3.5`) and click **Fetch Fresh Image**. Wait for the download to complete — the Vulkan Windows profile uses a dedicated Docker image.
3. Click **Start Local**. The app automatically downloads `whisper-server.exe` if it is not already present, then starts the Docker backend.
4. During the setup prompts: select a GGML model as your **Main Transcriber** and (optionally) a GGML model for **Live Mode**. Diarization is not supported on this path — skip it.
5. Wait for the server status to turn green. You are ready to transcribe.

> **`whisper-server.exe` location:** stored at `%APPDATA%\TranscriptionSuite\whisper-server\whisper-server.exe` and managed automatically by the app. You do not need to install or configure it manually.

#### 2.5.3 Setup walk-through (Linux)

> Windows users: see the step-by-step in §2.5.2 — the setup is integrated into the dashboard and does not require the manual steps below.

**How to set it up:**

1. In the dashboard, select **Vulkan** as the runtime profile (instead of GPU or CPU) when starting the server.
2. The dashboard will automatically start the whisper-server helper container alongside the main container.
3. Select a GGML model as your transcription model - the dashboard will suggest **`ggml-large-v3-turbo-q8_0.bin`** as a starting point.
4. Download the model using the **Model Manager** tab (the download button streams the file directly from HuggingFace into the models volume - no Python or CLI tools needed).
5. Click **Start Server** - the whisper-server sidecar will load the model and the main container will route requests to it.

> **Model switching:** The whisper.cpp sidecar loads its model once at startup. To switch models, stop the server, select the new model, then start again.

**Recommended model:** `ggml-large-v3-turbo-q8_0.bin` (~1.4 GB) - best balance of speed, quality, and VRAM usage for most AMD/Intel GPUs.

**Available GGML models:**

| Model | Size | Languages | Translation | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `ggml-large-v3.bin` | ~3.1 GB | 99 | Yes | Highest accuracy |
| `ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin` | ~2.1 GB | 99 | Yes | Good accuracy, lower VRAM |
| `ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin` | ~1.6 GB | 99 | No | Fast, no translation |
| `ggml-large-v3-turbo-q5_0.bin` | ~1.1 GB | 99 | No | Compact, fast |
| **`ggml-large-v3-turbo-q8_0.bin`** | **~1.4 GB** | **99** | **No** | **Recommended** |
| `ggml-medium.bin` | ~1.5 GB | 99 | Yes | Good multilingual option |
| `ggml-medium-q5_0.bin` | ~1.0 GB | 99 | Yes | Compact multilingual |
| `ggml-medium.en.bin` | ~1.5 GB | English | No | English-only |
| `ggml-small.bin` | ~465 MB | 99 | Yes | Lightweight |
| `ggml-small-q5_1.bin` | ~370 MB | 99 | Yes | Smallest multilingual |
| `ggml-small.en.bin` | ~465 MB | English | No | Smallest English-only |

**What works and what doesn't:**

| Feature | Vulkan (AMD/Intel) | NVIDIA (CUDA) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Longform transcription | Yes | Yes |
| Translation (to English) | Yes (except turbo models) | Yes |
| Speaker diarization | No | Yes |
| Live mode | Yes | Yes |
| Multiple concurrent jobs | One at a time | One at a time |

**Troubleshooting:**

- _"Requires CUDA" badge on model_ - You are in Vulkan mode. Use a GGML model instead (the CUDA models won't work with the Vulkan sidecar).
- _Download fails_ - Make sure the server container is running before downloading models. The download runs inside the container.
- _Sidecar health check timeout_ - The model is still loading. Large GGML files can take 30–60 seconds to initialize on first start.

> **Note for older AMD GPUs (RDNA1):** If you experience Vulkan initialization errors with an RX 5500 XT or similar RDNA1 card, you may need to add `iommu=soft` to your kernel boot parameters.

> **Note for Windows users:** if transcription is unexpectedly slow, make sure Docker Desktop is running with the WSL2 backend (Settings → General → "Use the WSL 2 based engine"). CPU-only fallback cannot be detected automatically from the dashboard.

---

## 3. Remote Connection

TranscriptionSuite supports remote transcription where a **server machine** (with a
GPU) runs the Docker container and a **client machine** connects to it via the
Dashboard app. Two connection profiles are available:

| Profile | Use Case | Network Requirement |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Tailscale** | Cross-network / internet (recommended) | Both machines on the same [Tailnet](https://tailscale.com/) |
| **LAN** | Same local network, no Tailscale needed | Both machines on the same LAN / subnet |

Both profiles use **HTTPS + token authentication**. The only difference is *how* the
client reaches the server and *where* the TLS certificates come from.

> **Remote profile chooser:** When you click **Start Remote** without Tailscale
> certificates configured, a dialog asks you to choose between **LAN** and **Tailscale**.
> Pick **LAN** if both machines are on the same local network - no extra setup is needed
> (a self-signed certificate is generated automatically). Pick **Tailscale** if you need
> cross-network access (requires Tailscale certificates - see Section 3.1 below).
> You can change this later in **Settings → Client → Remote Profile**.

**Security model:**

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| **Tailscale Network** *(Tailscale profile)* | Only devices on your Tailnet can reach the server |
| **TLS/HTTPS** | All traffic encrypted with certificates |
| **Token Authentication** | Required for all API requests in remote mode |

### 3.1 Option A: Tailscale (recommended)

Use this when the server and client are on **different networks** (e.g., home
server ↔ work laptop), or when you want Tailscale's zero-config networking
and automatic DNS.

#### Server Machine Setup

**Step 1 - Install & Authenticate Tailscale**

1. Install Tailscale: [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)
2. Authenticate: `sudo tailscale up` (Linux) or via the Tailscale app (Windows/macOS)
3. Go to [Tailscale Admin Console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin) → **DNS** tab
4. Enable **MagicDNS** and **HTTPS Certificates**

Your DNS settings should look like this:

![Tailscale DNS Settings](assets/tailscale-dns-settings.png)

**Step 2 - Generate TLS Certificates** *(server machine only)*

```bash
# Replace with your actual machine name + tailnet
sudo tailscale cert your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net
```

This produces two files: `your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.crt` and
`your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.key`. Move and rename them to the standard
location so the app can find them without config changes:

*(To change the default location, edit `remote_server.tls.host_cert_path` and
`host_key_path` in `config.yaml`.)*

**Linux:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/Tailscale
mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.crt ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.crt
mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.key ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.key
sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.*
chmod 600 ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.key
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
mkdir "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Tailscale" -Force
mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.crt "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Tailscale\my-machine.crt"
mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.key "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Tailscale\my-machine.key"
```

For Windows, also update the certificate paths in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
remote_server:
  tls:
    host_cert_path: "~/Documents/Tailscale/my-machine.crt"
    host_key_path: "~/Documents/Tailscale/my-machine.key"
```

> **Note:** Tailscale HTTPS certificates are issued for `.ts.net` hostnames, so
> MagicDNS must be enabled in your Tailnet.
>
> **Certificate expiry:** These certificates expire after **90 days**. When they expire the app will attempt to auto-renew via `tailscale cert` before starting the server. If auto-renewal fails, renew manually:
> ```bash
> sudo tailscale cert your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net
> mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.crt ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.crt
> mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.key ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.key
> ```

**Step 3 - Start the Server in Remote Mode**

1. Open the Dashboard on the server machine
2. Navigate to the **Server** view
3. Click **Start Remote**
4. Wait for the container to become healthy (green status)

On the first remote start, an admin **auth token** is generated automatically.
You can find it in the Server view's "Auth Token" field, or in the container logs:
```bash
docker compose logs | grep "Admin Token:"
```

Copy this token - you'll need it on the client machine.

> **Tailscale hostname:** Once the server is running, the Server view displays the
> machine's Tailscale FQDN (e.g., `desktop.tail1234.ts.net`) with a copy button.
> Use this exact hostname when configuring clients - don't enter just the tailnet
> suffix (e.g., `tail1234.ts.net`).

**Step 4 - Open the Firewall Port (Linux)**

If the server machine runs a firewall, port 9786 must be open for
remote clients to reach the server. Without this, connections silently time out.

| Distribution | Command |
|---|---|
| **Ubuntu / Debian** (`ufw`) | `sudo ufw allow 9786/tcp comment 'TranscriptionSuite Server'` |
| **Fedora GNOME / Fedora KDE** (`firewalld`) | `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9786/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload` |

The dashboard will show a firewall warning banner on the Server view if it
detects the port may be blocked.

> **Note:** This step is only needed on Linux with an active firewall. Windows and
> macOS do not typically block Docker ports by default.

#### Client Machine Setup

1. Install Tailscale on the client machine and sign in with the **same account**
   as the server machine (so both devices are on the same Tailnet)
2. Open the Dashboard on the client machine
3. Go to **Settings** → **Client** tab
4. Enable **"Use remote server instead of local"**
5. Select **Tailscale** as the remote profile
6. Enter the server's **full Tailscale hostname** in the host field
   (e.g., `my-machine.tail1234.ts.net`) - copy it from the Server view on the
   server machine
7. Set port to **`9786`**
8. **Use HTTPS** will be automatically enabled
9. Paste the **auth token** from the server into the Auth Token field
10. Close the Settings modal - the client now connects to the remote server

> **Tip:** The client machine does *not* need certificates, Docker, or a GPU.
> It only needs Tailscale running and a valid auth token.

> **Common mistake:** Enter the **full machine hostname** (e.g.,
> `desktop.tail1234.ts.net`), not just the tailnet name (`tail1234.ts.net`).
> The Settings modal will warn you if it detects a bare tailnet name without a
> machine prefix.

### 3.2 Option B: LAN (same local network)

Use this when both machines are on the **same local network** and you don't want
to use Tailscale. This is common for home-lab setups or office environments.

LAN mode uses the same HTTPS + token authentication as Tailscale mode - the only
differences are the hostname (LAN IP or local DNS name instead of a `.ts.net`
address) and the certificate source (self-signed, local CA, or other locally
trusted certificate instead of a Tailscale-issued one).

#### Server Machine Setup

**Step 1 - TLS Certificate**

LAN mode requires a TLS certificate. The dashboard **auto-generates** a
self-signed certificate on the first remote start if none exists, covering
`localhost` and all detected LAN IP addresses. No manual steps are needed in
most cases.

> **Custom certificate (optional):** If you prefer to use your own certificate
> (e.g., from an internal CA), place it at the paths in `config.yaml` under
> `remote_server.tls.lan_host_cert_path` / `lan_host_key_path`
> (defaults: `~/.config/TranscriptionSuite/lan-server.crt` / `.key` on Linux,
> `~/Documents/TranscriptionSuite/lan-server.crt` / `.key` on Windows).

**Step 2 - Start the Server in Remote Mode**

Same as Tailscale above:
1. Open the Dashboard, go to **Server** view, click **Start Remote**
2. Copy the auth token once the container is healthy

**Step 3 - Open the Firewall Port (Linux)**

Same as Tailscale above - if a firewall is active:

| Distribution | Command |
|---|---|
| **Ubuntu / Debian** (`ufw`) | `sudo ufw allow 9786/tcp` |
| **Fedora GNOME / Fedora KDE** (`firewalld`) | `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9786/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload` |

#### Client Machine Setup

1. Open the Dashboard on the client machine
2. Go to **Settings** → **Client** tab
3. Enable **"Use remote server instead of local"**
4. Select **LAN** as the remote profile
5. Enter the server's **LAN IP or hostname** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
6. Set port to **`9786`**
7. **Use HTTPS** will be automatically enabled
8. Paste the **auth token** from the server
9. Close Settings - the client now connects over your local network

> **Note on Kubernetes / custom deployments:** If you run the server container
> directly (e.g., via Kubernetes or your own Docker setup), you can still use the
> LAN profile on the client. Just point the LAN host at your load balancer or
> service IP. The server image is available at
> `ghcr.io/homelab-00/transcriptionsuite-server`. Ensure `TLS_ENABLED=true` and
> the certificate/key are mounted at `/certs/cert.crt` and `/certs/cert.key`
> inside the container.

## 4. OpenAI-compatible API Endpoints

*Note: This is a summary. For more info about API endpoints, see section 7 of README_DEV.*

Mounted at `/v1/audio/`. These endpoints follow the [OpenAI Audio API spec](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio) so that OpenAI-compatible clients (Open-WebUI, LM Studio, etc.) can point at TranscriptionSuite as a drop-in STT backend.

**Auth:** Same rules as all other API routes - Bearer token required in TLS mode; open to localhost in local mode.

**Error shape:** All errors follow the OpenAI error envelope:
```json
{"error": {"message": "...", "type": "...", "param": null, "code": null}}
```

#### `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`

Transcribe an audio or video file. Language auto-detected when `language` is omitted.

**Form fields:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | `UploadFile` | required | Audio or video file |
| `model` | `string` | `"whisper-1"` | Accepted but ignored; the server uses whatever model is configured |
| `language` | `string` | auto-detect | BCP-47 language code (e.g. `en`, `fr`) |
| `prompt` | `string` | `null` | Initial prompt passed to the transcription engine as `initial_prompt` |
| `response_format` | `string` | `"json"` | One of `json`, `text`, `verbose_json`, `srt`, `vtt`, `diarized_json` |
| `temperature` | `float` | `null` | Accepted but ignored |
| `timestamp_granularities[]` | `list[string]` | `null` | Include `"word"` to enable word-level timestamps (effective with `verbose_json` / `diarized_json`) |
| `diarization` | `bool` | `false` | When `true`, run speaker diarization and attach speaker labels to segments |
| `expected_speakers` | `int (1-10)` | `null` | Exact speaker count hint; out-of-range values return `400` |
| `parallel_diarization` | `bool` | server config | Override parallel vs sequential diarize + transcribe for this call |

**Response formats:**

| `response_format` | Content-Type | Shape |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| `json` | `application/json` | `{"text": "..."}` — minimal OpenAI body; never leaks speaker labels |
| `text` | `text/plain` | Raw transcript string |
| `verbose_json` | `application/json` | Full OpenAI object (`task`, `language`, `duration`, `text`, `segments`, optional `words`); gains per-segment `speaker` and top-level `num_speakers` when diarization ran |
| `srt` | `text/plain` | SRT subtitle file; cues prefixed `Speaker 1:`, `Speaker 2:` when diarization ran |
| `vtt` | `text/plain` | WebVTT subtitle file; same speaker prefix as SRT |
| `diarized_json` | `application/json` | Compact `{task, language, duration, text, num_speakers, segments}` with `speaker`, `start`, `end`, `text` per segment (raw `SPEAKER_00` form for programmatic use) |

**Speaker labels:** JSON bodies (`verbose_json`, `diarized_json`) use raw `SPEAKER_00`/`SPEAKER_01` form for stable programmatic identifiers. Subtitle formats (`srt`, `vtt`) normalize to `Speaker 1`/`Speaker 2` — same convention the dashboard's longform export uses.

**Diarization failure tolerance:** If `diarization=true` is requested but the diarization engine fails (no HF token, OOM, merge error), the endpoint returns 200 with a plain transcript (`num_speakers=0`, no `speaker` keys) and logs a WARNING server-side. Diarization hiccups never 5xx the call.

**Error codes:**

| Status | `type` | Cause |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `400` | `invalid_request_error` | Unknown `response_format`, missing/empty `file`, `expected_speakers` out of 1–10 |
| `429` | `rate_limit_error` | Another transcription job is already running |
| `503` | `server_error` | No transcription model is configured |
| `500` | `server_error` | Internal engine error |

**Example — diarized verbose transcript (curl):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9786/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@recording.wav" \
  -F "diarization=true" \
  -F "expected_speakers=2" \
  -F "response_format=diarized_json"
```

**Example — word-level verbose (curl):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9786/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@recording.wav" \
  -F "response_format=verbose_json" \
  -F "timestamp_granularities[]=word"
```

#### `POST /v1/audio/translations`

Transcribe **and translate** an audio or video file to English. Identical to `/transcriptions` except:
- `language` is not accepted (source language is always auto-detected)
- Translation target is always English
- The `task` field in `verbose_json` responses is `"translate"` instead of `"transcribe"`

**Form fields:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | `UploadFile` | required | Audio or video file |
| `model` | `string` | `"whisper-1"` | Accepted but ignored |
| `prompt` | `string` | `null` | Initial prompt passed to the transcription engine |
| `response_format` | `string` | `"json"` | One of `json`, `text`, `verbose_json`, `srt`, `vtt`, `diarized_json` |
| `temperature` | `float` | `null` | Accepted but ignored |
| `timestamp_granularities[]` | `list[string]` | `null` | Include `"word"` to enable word-level timestamps |
| `diarization` | `bool` | `false` | Same semantics as `/transcriptions` — speaker labels attach to the translated segments |
| `expected_speakers` | `int (1-10)` | `null` | Exact speaker count hint |
| `parallel_diarization` | `bool` | server config | Override parallel vs sequential orchestration |

**Error codes:** Same as `/transcriptions`.

> **Backend note:** Translation requires a Whisper-family model with translation capability. Parakeet/Canary backends that don't support `task="translate"` will return a `400` or `500` from the engine layer.

**Example (curl):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9786/v1/audio/translations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@foreign_audio.mp3" \
  -F "response_format=text"
```

**Example — diarized translation (curl):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9786/v1/audio/translations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@foreign_audio.mp3" \
  -F "diarization=true" \
  -F "response_format=diarized_json"
```

## 5. Outgoing Webhooks

TranscriptionSuite can send HTTP POST requests to an external URL whenever a transcription event occurs. This lets you pipe transcription results into your own applications, automation pipelines, or logging services.

Two event types are supported:

| Event | Fires when |
|-------|------------|
| `live_sentence` | A sentence is completed during Live Mode |
| `longform_complete` | A file/import/notebook transcription job finishes |

### Setup

Open **Settings → Server** tab. In the **Outgoing Webhook** section:

1. **Enable** the webhook toggle
2. Enter the **URL** to receive POST requests
3. *(Optional)* Enter a **Secret** - sent as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` on every request
4. Click **Send Test Webhook** to verify your endpoint receives the request

These settings are also editable directly in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
webhook:
    enabled: true
    url: "https://your-api.example.com/webhook"
    secret: "your-optional-secret"
```

### Payload Format

Every webhook POST has `Content-Type: application/json` with this envelope:

```json
{
  "event": "live_sentence",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-24T14:30:00.123456+00:00",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

**Live sentence payload:**

```json
{
  "source": "live",
  "text": "The completed sentence."
}
```

**Longform completion payload:**

```json
{
  "source": "longform",
  "text": "Full transcript text...",
  "filename": "meeting.wav",
  "duration": 1234.56,
  "language": "en",
  "num_speakers": 2
}
```

> **Note:** Delivery is fire-and-forget - the server sends each webhook once and does not retry on failure. Failed deliveries are logged on the server side.

## 6. Troubleshooting

As with most things, the first thing to try is turning them off and on again. Stop the server/client, quit the app and then try again.

The next step is to start deleting things. The safest choice is deleting *everything*, but that means having to redownload everything and losing whatever recordings you've saved in the Notebook (unless you create a backup). Volumes 'data' & 'models' don't usually need to be removed for example.

Controls for all these actions can be found in the Server tab. Here you can remove the container, image, and volumes individually or use the big red button at the bottom (that can also remove your config folder).

### GPU not working after a system update (Linux)

If the server crashes with `CUDA failed with error unknown error` after a system update (common on rolling-release distros like Arch), your NVIDIA driver likely updated past what the legacy Docker GPU hook supports. The fix is to switch to CDI mode:

```bash
sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml
sudo nvidia-ctk config --in-place --set nvidia-container-runtime.mode=cdi
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

The dashboard detects CDI automatically and uses the correct GPU configuration. No image rebuild or reinstall needed.

### Dashboard shows GPU error / red status

**Symptom:** The dashboard shows a red error state with "GPU unavailable" in the Session view and red dots in the sidebar.

**Steps:**

1. **Restart your computer** to fully reset the GPU driver state. This resolves most cases of CUDA error 999 (driver context poisoning from a prior crash).
2. If the error recurs frequently, enable NVIDIA Persistence Mode on the host to prevent the driver from entering a degraded state on container stop/start cycles:
   ```bash
   sudo nvidia-smi -pm 1
   ```
3. If the error persists after a reboot, check the server logs for the CUDA diagnostic line (logged at startup). It contains the torch version, CUDA version, and device nodes - useful for reporting the issue.
4. **Advanced:** `sudo nvidia-smi --gpu-reset` can reset the GPU without a full reboot, but this affects all processes using the GPU on the host.
5. **Workaround:** Switch to CPU mode in **Settings > Server** while you investigate.

### GPU errors persist across container restarts

**Symptom:** `nvidia-smi` shows a healthy GPU, but the server logs report CUDA error 999 every time the container starts.

**Cause:** The NVIDIA driver can enter a degraded context when a container exits uncleanly. Without Persistence Mode, the driver resets incompletely on the next attach.

**Solution:** Enable NVIDIA Persistence Mode on the host:

```bash
sudo nvidia-smi -pm 1
```

This keeps the driver context warm across container lifecycle events. The setting persists until the next reboot. To make it permanent, install the included systemd unit:

```bash
sudo cp build/nvidia-persistence.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now nvidia-persistence.service
```

**Alternative:** Reboot the host to fully reset the driver state.

### Windows / CPU-only: local start fails

**Symptom:** On a CPU-only machine (no NVIDIA GPU), first start fails during dependency install — either with `invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer` while downloading packages, or later with `UnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode ...` when loading the model.

**Steps:**

1. **Use the CPU profile.** In **Settings > Server**, select the **CPU** profile before starting. CPU-only hosts no longer download the multi-GB NVIDIA CUDA wheels and default to a lighter faster-whisper model instead of the GPU-only NeMo model.
2. **`UnknownIssuer` / certificate errors** mean your network (a corporate proxy or antivirus HTTPS scanning) is intercepting HTTPS, so the container can't verify the package index. Set `UV_NATIVE_TLS=true` and add your organization's root CA — see the [deployment guide](deployment-guide.md#tls-interception--corporate-network-unknownissuer).
3. **`UnicodeEncodeError` on model load** means a HuggingFace token containing a non-ASCII character was provided. Clear the token (most models don't need one); the server now also ignores non-ASCII tokens automatically and downloads anonymously.

## 9. State of the Project

### 9.1 In General & AI Disclosure

This was initially developed as a personal tool and in time turned into a hobby project. I am an engineer, just not a *software* engineer; so **this whole thing is vibecoded**. At the same time it's not blind vibecoding; for example Dockerizing the server for easy distribution was 100% my idea.

I'm using this project to learn about programming. Starting from virtually nothing, I can now say that I've got a decent grasp of Python, git, uv & Docker. I started doing this because it's fun, not to make money. Though I do find, despite my mech eng degree, that I want to follow it as a career.

Anyways, since I'm 100% dogfooding the app I'm not going to abandon it (unless some other project makes mine completely redundant). I will also try to the best of my ability to deal with bugs as soon as possible.

Finally, I want to thank [RealtimeSTT](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT) for inspiring this project.

### 9.2 Contributing

I'm always open to contributors! Might help me learn a thing or two about programming.
